# PhantomGambit
The Phantom Gambit is a smart chessboard that can move pieces on its own, letting you play chess hands-free. Using hidden magnets and a tiny computer, it smoothly glides pieces across the board as if by magic. Whether you're playing against a friend or an AI, the board brings a unique, almost lifelike experience to the gameâ€”it's like having an invisible opponent right there with you.
